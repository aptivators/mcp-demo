## Setup Instructions

1. **Start your MCP servers** (ensure they're running on the configured ports)
2. **Get your Gemini API key** from Google AI Studio
3. **Configure the frontend:**
    - Enter your Gemini API key
    - Set correct server URLs (default: `localhost:3000` for Medicare, `localhost:3001` for Azure)
    - Test connections to ensure servers are responding

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Azure Integration Notes

- The frontend is designed to work with Azure SDK authentication.
- Ensure your Azure MCP server exposes the standard MCP endpoints:
  - `GET /health` - Health check
  - `GET /tools` - Available tools
  - `GET /resources` - Available resources
  - `POST /call-tool` - Execute tools
- Handle Azure authentication in your server-side implementation using the Azure SDK
- Configure Azure credentials in the settings panel when needed
